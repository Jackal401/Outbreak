# Outbreak
A video game group project I took part in for my GIT211 Game Development II class at Arizona State University.
In this project, me and my group were given the opportunity to come up with our own game with its own theme
so long as it had enough work for 4-6 people. I was a part of a 5 person group and we decided to build off
this project off of one of our earlier group projects, which was basically a zombie survival horror game
where the theme of that project was that things would change where the player was not looking. When this
happens, more zombies spawn and approach the player. 

For this final project, I was in charge of the user interface aspects of the game. I found free assets online 
such as the art for the player's health bar and fonts used for text. I also had to develop the behavior of the 
player's interactions, such as losing health upon contact with enemies and gaining health by clicking on med 
packs scattered throughout the level. In addition, I worked on the screens for starting the game, winning the game, 
and losing the game. This consisted of creating and adjusting a background image and creating interactions between 
the player and button options displayed, such as starting the game or quitting the game. 

Me and my group members were taking this class online at the time, so we had to communicate with each other through
Discord. Here, we met at least once per week to discuss how we were progressing with the tasks we decided to work
on and to help each other out when there was something that we weren't sure of. We were good about asking questions
outside of our meeting times and we each found the time to help each other out. In the end, we managed to complete a 
playable game for our instructor and got a passing grade.
